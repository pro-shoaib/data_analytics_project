Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of **[mention industry, e.g., retail sales data]** to identify key growth drivers and operational inefficiencies. I performed end-to-end data processing—from cleaning raw datasets and executing complex SQL queries to visualizing insights in an interactive Power BI dashboard and generating an AI-assisted executive report.

## 📊 Dataset

* **Source:** [e.g., Kaggle / Company Database / UCI Repository]
* **Size:** [e.g., 50,000+ rows]
* **Key Features:** [e.g., Transaction ID, Customer Demographics, Product Categories, Profit Margins, and Date Stamps].

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Data Cleaning:** Python (Pandas) / Excel Power Query
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (can be swapped for MySQL or SQL Server)
* **Visualization:** Power BI
* **Reporting:** Microsoft Word / PDF
* **Presentation:** Gamma (AI-powered slide deck)

## ⚙️ Project Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning & Transformation

Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized data formats to ensure accuracy.

* *Key Task:* Converted data types for date-time analysis and handled outliers in the "Price" column.

### 2. SQL Analysis

Loaded the cleaned data into **PostgreSQL** to perform deep-dive analysis.

* **Key Queries:** Included Joins, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), and Window Functions to calculate Year-over-Year (YoY) growth and customer lifetime value (CLV).

### 3. Power BI Dashboarding

Developed an interactive multi-page dashboard to track KPIs such as Total Revenue, Retention Rate, and Regional Performance.

### 4. Executive Reporting & PPT

* **Report:** Summarized technical findings into actionable business insights.
* **Gamma PPT:** Leveraged **Gamma** to transform findings into a visually engaging presentation for stakeholders.

* **Key Insights Found:**
* Insight 1: [e.g., Sales peaked in Q4 due to holiday promotions.]
* Insight 2: [e.g., The "Electronics" category has the highest return rate (12%).]
* Insight 3: [e.g., 20% of customers contribute to 80% of total revenue.]
